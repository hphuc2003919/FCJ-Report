### Week 4 Achievements:

#### Project Development:

  - Spent the entire week working on frontend implementation for the group project.
  - Improved UI structure, layout, and basic component workflows.
  - Collaborated with team members to align frontend with backend requirements and API design.

#### AWS Theory Learned:

  - Gained an in-depth understanding of Amazon EC2, including:
  - Instance types for different workloads.
  - AMIs and backup strategies.
  - Key pairs and instance authentication.
  - EBS vs Instance Store and their use cases.
  - User Data scripting for automation.
  - Metadata for instance information retrieval.
  - Learned about EC2 Auto Scaling, how it adapts to load changes automatically.
  - Explored advanced compute-related services:
  - EFS for scalable shared file storage.
  - FSx for high-performance workloads.
  - Lightsail for simplified cloud hosting.
  - MGN for migrating servers to AWS.

#### Hands-on Labs Completed:

  - Deploy AWS Backup to the System
  → Learned how to configure backups for EC2, EBS, and other resources.

  - Using File Storage Gateway
  → Practiced hybrid storage integration and working with on-premises file systems.

  - Starting with Amazon S3
  → Understood S3 buckets, versioning, storage classes, encryption, and object lifecycle policies.

#### Other Activities

  - Began translating blogs.
  - The translation is still in progress.

#### Skills Gained:
- Technical Skills

  - Strengthened frontend development skills: responsive UI, component design, and user interaction handling.
  - Gained solid understanding of EC2, AMIs, EBS vs Instance Store, User Data, Metadata, and Auto Scaling.
  - Learned additional compute/storage services: EFS, FSx, Lightsail, and AWS MGN.
  - Completed hands-on labs using AWS Backup, File Storage Gateway, and Amazon S3 (bucket creation, versioning, lifecycle, encryption).

- Cloud Architecture Skills

  - Improved ability to select suitable storage solutions (EBS/EFS/S3/FSx).
  - Learned best practices for scalable and secure compute environments.

- Soft Skills

  - Improved teamwork while developing the project frontend.
  - Enhanced time management and problem-solving through lab and project tasks.
