### Overall Experience

Joining the First Cloud Journey program and working on a project with other members during the First Cloud Journey program has been an eye-opening experience. I enjoyed being part of a real-world project that combines cloud services, backend systems, and security-focused file analysis. It gave me the chance to see how different components interact in a distributed system and how important careful planning is for scalability and reliability.

### Collaboration and Mentorship 

I appreciated the support and guidance from the admin team and team members. They were always ready to explain concepts, answer questions, and give constructive feedback. I especially valued that I was encouraged to try solutions on my own, which helped me develop problem-solving skills and confidence in my abilities.

### Skills and Knowledge Gained

Through this project, I learned:

- How to design and implement a modular multi-service architecture for real-world applications.
- Practical use of cloud deployment and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) for creating scalable and reproducible environments.
- Importance of secure file handling and data persistence in a distributed system.
- How to integrate frontend, backend, and database services effectively while maintaining clean code structure.
- Enhanced team collaboration and professional communication, especially when coordinating tasks and reviewing code.

### Most Satisfying Aspect

The most rewarding part was seeing my contributions directly impact the workflow of the system, whether it was improving a service interaction, handling file validation, or ensuring proper database integration. Successfully solving challenges independently gave me a sense of accomplishment.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- More structured peer review sessions or code walkthroughs could help interns learn from each other and improve code quality.
- Occasional team-building or knowledge-sharing sessions could strengthen team relationships and foster cross-learning.

### Overall Reflection 

This internship and project experience taught me not only technical skills but also the importance of collaboration, feedback, and structured problem-solving. It has reinforced my interest in cloud development and secure software design, and I feel better prepared for future projects in these areas.
