###  [Blog 1 - Streaming Windows Games using Proton 9 on Amazon GameLift Streams](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces Proton 9 as a new runtime option for Amazon GameLift Streams, allowing Windows games to run on Linux servers with improved compatibility and cost efficiency. It explains how Proton translates Windows API calls (including DirectX to Vulkan) to enable multi-tenancy, reduce licensing costs, and maintain comparable performance to Windows runtimes. The key takeaway is that developers can optimize both technical performance and infrastructure costs by using Proton 9 while being mindful of potential compatibility challenges such as anti-cheat and graphics API translation.
