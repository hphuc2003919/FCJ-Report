# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 – AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

### Event Objectives

- Introduce participants to core Generative AI concepts and AWS AI/ML services
- Provide practical, hands-on guidance for building GenAI applications with Amazon Bedrock
- Demonstrate prompt engineering, RAG architecture, and AI agent workflow design
- Highlight best practices for safety, content moderation, and responsible AI

### Speakers

- **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Sr DevOps Engineer, FPT Software
- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud
- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey

### Key Highlights

- Foundation Models (FMs): Comparison of Claude, Llama, and Amazon Titan; criteria for selecting the right FM
- Prompt Engineering: Chain-of-thought reasoning, few-shot prompting, and optimization techniques
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Architecture, knowledge base integration, and real-world use cases
- Bedrock Agents: Multi-step workflow orchestration and tool integrations
- Guardrails: Safety, filtering, and secure content generation
- Live Demo: Building a generative AI chatbot using Amazon Bedrock
