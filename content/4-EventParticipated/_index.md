During my internship, I participated in four events. Each one was a memorable experience that provided new, interesting, and useful knowledge, along with gifts and wonderful moments.

### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders  

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 09:00 - 17:00, September 18, 2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Description:** The event began with opening remarks from government representatives and keynote addresses from AWS leaders, Techcombank and U2U Network CEOs. A panel discussion with executives from ELSA Corp, Nexttech Group, and TymeX explored strategies for navigating the GenAI revolution. In the afternoon, I attended Track 1: GenAI and Data, which covered topics such as building unified data foundations on AWS, GenAI adoption roadmaps, AI-driven development lifecycles (AI-DLC), securing generative AI applications, and the role of AI agents as productivity multipliers.

&emsp;**Outcomes/Value Gained:**

- Strengthened my understanding of how AWS supports scalable data infrastructure for AI and analytics workloads.
- Learned best practices for securing generative AI applications with AWS’s built-in measures.
- Gained insights into the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) and how AI can act as a co-developer.
- Understood the roadmap for GenAI adoption and its impact on shaping future innovation.
- Improved awareness of the evolving role of AI agents in enhancing productivity beyond traditional automation.

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Description:** This event focused on practical applications of Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock, covering foundation model selection (Claude, Llama, Titan), prompt engineering techniques, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, Bedrock Agents for multi-step workflows, and guardrails for content safety. The session included a live demo showing how to build a GenAI chatbot using Bedrock services.

&emsp;**Outcomes/Value Gained:**

- Strengthened understanding of foundation models and how to choose the right one based on use cases.
- Gained practical skills in prompt engineering, CoT reasoning, and few-shot learning.
- Learned how to design and implement RAG systems and integrate knowledge bases effectively.
- Understood how to build AI agents with multi-step workflows using Bedrock Agents.
- Improved awareness of safety practices such as guardrails and content filtering.
- Developed hands-on experience through the live demo of constructing a GenAI chatbot.

### [Event 4](4.4-Event4/)  

&emsp;**Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 – AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 8:30 – 12:00, November 29, 2025

&emsp;**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee

&emsp;**Description:** This event provided a deep dive into the security best practices recommended by AWS across the five core pillars: Identity & Access Management (IAM), Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, and Incident Response. The workshop covered modern IAM architecture, multi-account governance, detection and monitoring strategies, network and workload protection, encryption and secrets management, and hands-on approaches to incident response. Real-world examples, demos, and discussions highlighted how organizations in Vietnam can strengthen their cloud security posture using AWS-native services and automation.

&emsp;**Outcomes/Value Gained:**

- Deep understanding of the AWS Security Pillar and how each of the five pillars contributes to a secure cloud architecture.
- Improved knowledge of modern IAM practices, including Identity Center, permission boundaries, SCPs, and avoiding long-term credentials.
- Practical experience in continuous monitoring, leveraging CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, and EventBridge for detection and alert automation.
- Clear strategies for securing infrastructure, including VPC segmentation, Security Groups vs NACLs, and protection via WAF, Shield, and Network Firewall.
- Stronger grasp of data protection principles: KMS key management, encryption patterns, secrets rotation, and data classification.
- Hands-on insight into incident response workflows, from detecting compromised keys to isolating infected workloads and automating remediation using Lambda and Step Functions.
- Awareness of common cloud security pitfalls, especially for Vietnamese enterprises transitioning or scaling on AWS.
- Roadmap for further learning, including preparation toward AWS Security Specialty and Solutions Architect Professional certifications.
