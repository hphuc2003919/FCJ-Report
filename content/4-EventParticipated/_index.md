During my internship, I participated in four events. Each one was a memorable experience that provided new, interesting, and useful knowledge, along with gifts and wonderful moments.

### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)  
&emsp;**Event Name:** Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders  

&emsp;**Date & Time:** 09:00 - 17:00, September 18, 2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Description:** The event began with opening remarks from government representatives and keynote addresses from AWS leaders, Techcombank and U2U Network CEOs. A panel discussion with executives from ELSA Corp, Nexttech Group, and TymeX explored strategies for navigating the GenAI revolution. In the afternoon, I attended Track 1: GenAI and Data, which covered topics such as building unified data foundations on AWS, GenAI adoption roadmaps, AI-driven development lifecycles (AI-DLC), securing generative AI applications, and the role of AI agents as productivity multipliers.

&emsp;**Outcomes/Value Gained:**

- Strengthened my understanding of how AWS supports scalable data infrastructure for AI and analytics workloads.
- Learned best practices for securing generative AI applications with AWS’s built-in measures.
- Gained insights into the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) and how AI can act as a co-developer.
- Understood the roadmap for GenAI adoption and its impact on shaping future innovation.
- Improved awareness of the evolving role of AI agents in enhancing productivity beyond traditional automation.
